	<!-- We are gonna learn form & input tags -->


	<!-- This is a form tag -->
	<form></form>


	<!-- form tags are used to collect information from user photos, text e.t.c -->



	<!-- we can use action attribute for back-end process of data through technologies -->


	<!-- like php, ruby, python -->
	<form action="www.cubeacloud.com"></form>



	<!-- there are two methods that specifies the http (GET or POST) -->



	<!-- GET method is more visible and POST is more secure. POST method is used more often in websites with form -->




	<!-- to take input from user, we need the <input> element  -->
	<!-- <input> element has many variations -->
	<!-- it can be text, radio, url, password, submit e.t.c -->
	<!-- Example is given below on how to use them -->

	<form><input type="username" name="username"></form> <br>
	<form><input type="password" name="password"></form>


<!-- These breaklines are just gimmick nothing to learn already taught before -->
<br>

<!-- now we will explain input element with deatils -->
<!-- by using input type "radio" to make radio buttons -->

<input type="radio" name="young" value="young">Are you a Teenager <br>
<input type="radio" name="old" value="old">Are you a Adult



<!-- These breaklines are just gimmick nothing to learn already taught before -->
<br>
<br>



<!-- Another Example with checkboxes -->
<input type="checkbox" name="young" value="young">Are you a Teenager <br>
<input type="checkbox" name="old" value="old">Are you a Adult



<!-- These breaklines are just gimmick nothing to learn already taught before -->
<br>
